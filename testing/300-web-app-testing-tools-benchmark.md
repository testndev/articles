## Introduction

In this article, I will compare some of **popular tools** used...

- _in_ software development of web applications,
- _for_ testing purposes,
- _in order_ to automatically control your web application in a browser and check its behavior.

I will try to be as objective as possible. It is not a "versus" article, not a "click bait" post, but a comparison of the characteristics, features and performance of each tool.

### selection of tools

We will focus on tools having those characteristics:

- **open-source** tools
- executable on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) platform
- with possible implementation in TypeScript
- and **mature** and quiet popular

We selected the following 5 tools:

1. [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io/)
2. [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org)
3. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
4. [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) (+ a JavaScript testing framework)
5. [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/)

In this article, and to be fair in the comparison, we will take JavaScript/TypeScript versions of Playwright and Selenium.

## Quick presentation of the compared tools

In the table below, the official quick presentations of the 5 tools, as given on their respective websites:

### Note about "Selenium WebDriver" in this comparison

As you can see, Selenium WebDriver (JavaScript version and the other) is **not a test framework** by itself, contrary to the 4 others. It is (only) a tool to automate browsers. If we want to use it for web-app testing purposes, we will need to integrate it with a testing framework (like Mocha, Jest, etc.).

In many articles/posts/videos, Selenium WebDriver is often compared to Cypress and/or Playwright, as it was, before them, the most popular open-source tool for web-app testing for many years. And it is still popular today. I will compare it to the 4 others in this article.

We will try to take this into account in our comparison, and for code examples, I will use a JavaScript testing framework (here Jest) to compare the 5 tools.

## Popularity of the 5 tools

One of the criteria to choose a tool is its popularity. The more popular a tool is, the more likely it is to be maintained, to have a large community, and to have a lot of resources available (tutorials, plugins, etc.).

To have an overview of "popularity" of each tool, I used indicators retrieved on NPM, GitHub and Google.

Of course, the popularity of a tool is not the only criterion to take into account when choosing a tool. But it is an important one.

In the ["**popularity of the 5 web-app. testing tools**" sub-page](./300-web-app-testing-tools-benchmark-popularity.html), I compare the popularity of the 5 tools, using several indicators.

As by mid-May 2025, the popularity of the 5 tools is as follows:

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚óªÔ∏è **"`Playwright test`" is the most popular** framework, since September 2024, and keep growing.
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è **"`Cypress`"** framework is the second most popular, and keep growing too.
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è **"`WebdriverIO`"** seems to be less popular than the 2 others frameworks (Cypress and Playwright), but its usage keeps growing (it's more used than Selenium WebDriver).
- ‚≠ê‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è **"`Selenium WebDriver`"** (as central part of a Node.js based framework) is still popular, but its popularity is slowly decreasing since 2022.
- ‚≠ê‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è Usage of **"`Nightwatch`"** seems to be stable, but its the less popular of the 5.

> Disclaimer: the following indicators are not exhaustive, and are only a snapshot of the popularity of the tools at the time of writing this article.

[![](../img/300/2025-05-25-relative-popularity-opensource-webapp-testing-tools-summary.1000px.png)](../img/300/2025-05-25-relative-popularity-opensource-webapp-testing-tools-summary.1800px.png)

## Community and Support

The 5 tools are officially "open source". But what does it mean? According to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd/), open source software is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition.

Those 5 tools are distributed under the following licenses:

- [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/) for Playwright and Selenium
- and [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for Cypress, Nighwatch and WebdriverIO

As other open source projects, those tools are developed by a community of contributors, and are often sponsored by companies.

The fact that a tool is sponsored by a company can be:

- a strong point üëç, as it can ensure the sustainability of the project, and the development of the tool
- or a weak point üëé, if the company decides to change its strategy, or to stop its support of the project

The table below gives you an overview of the licenses and sponsors of the 5 tools:

|         | Cypress         | Nighwatch       | Playwright         | Selenium           | WebdriverIO              |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| License | The MIT License | The MIT License | Apache License 2.0 | Apache License 2.0 | The MIT License          |
| Sponsor | Cypress.io      | BrowserStack    | Microsoft          | Community          | BrowserStack + SauceLabs |

### Notes for Cypress

Cypress is developed by [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/about-us), a US-based company that offers a commercial product based on the open-source project.

### Notes for Playwright

Playwright is an open-source project, but it is also a copyrighted product of Microsoft Corporation.
Playwright is developed in the _Developer Division_ at Microsoft (which also develops Visual Studio Code, TypeScript, etc.).

## Technical comparison

| aspect                  | Cypress        | Nighwatch      | Playwright             | Selenium + | WebdriverIO        |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Other than JS/TS?       | No, only JS/TS | No, only JS/TS | Yes (C#, Java, Python) | Yes, many  | No, only JS/TS     |
| Automation **Protocol** | Inside Browser | WebDriver      | CDP                    | WebDriver  | WebDriver (or CDP) |

### Automation Protocol

The 5 tools use different automation protocols:

- the standard [WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/), which is a W3C standard for browser automation.
- [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) or CDP. It's used by Playwright. It can be also used with WebdriverIO
- for Cypress, it is not a protocol, but a library that runs inside the browser. It is not based on WebDriver.

|                             | name               | WebDriver    | CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) | Other             |

### Cross-Browser Testing

All the 5 tools claims that have **cross-browser** capacity, but they have different capabilities and limitations.

In the below infographic, you can see the **browser compatibility** of the 5 tools, as of June 2025.

> - In columns, you can see the 5 tools, and in rows, you can see the browsers supported (or not) by each tool.
> - Browsers are sorted by their usage share, from the most used to the least used, according to [StatCounter Global Stats](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-202504-202504-bar).
> - The 3 last rows are for the browsers that are for Web browsers engines (Blink, Gecko and WebKit), on which all previous browsers are based.

#### Browsers render engine support

The 5 tools support automation on browsers based on the 3 main Web browsers engines (or rendering engines):

- **[<img src="../img/icons/chromium-logo.png" width="20" alt="Blink"> Blink](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)>)** browser engine, that powers [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and all other Chromium-based browsers, including [**Microsoft Edge**](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), Brave, Vivaldi, Opera...
- **[<img src="../img/icons/gecko-icon.png" width="20" alt="Gecko"> Gecko](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)>)** browser engine, that powers [**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)
- **[<img src="../img/icons/webkit-logo.png" width="20" alt="WebKit"> WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit)** browser engine, that powers [Apple's **Safari**](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (+ GNOME Web, Konqueror, Orion)

#### Browsers support

Some notes about the table above:

1. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **WebdriverIO** can control all browsers, including Safari and Firefox.
2. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Same for **Nightwatch.js**, as it is also based on WebDriver protocol.
3. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Custom frameworks based on **Selenium WebDriver** can control all browsers, including Safari and Firefox.
4. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è **Cypress**:
   - Cypress can control Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.), but not Safari (only experimental support on a WebKit based browser, the same used by Playwright).
   - Cypress can control Firefox via [geckodriver](https://docs.cypress.io/app/references/launching-browsers#Firefox-Browsers).
5. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚óªÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è **Playwright**:
   - Playwright supports all modern rendering engines, BUT it cannot run on a real branded Safari browser, as mentioned in [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#webkit). It simulates Safari with a in-house built WebKit-based browser.
   - Same for Firefox, as mentioned in [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#firefox).
   - Playwright can control 2 branded browsers based on Chromium: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge.
   - All its custom browsers are hosted on Microsoft's CDN, as mentioned [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#install-behind-a-firewall-or-a-proxy).

## Conclusion


In this article, I presented a benchmark of 5 popular open-source tools for web-applications testing: Cypress, Nightwatch.js, Playwright, Selenium WebDriver and WebdriverIO.

I compared their features, popularity, technical aspects, and community support.

I hope this article will help you to choose the right tool for your web-applications testing needs.
